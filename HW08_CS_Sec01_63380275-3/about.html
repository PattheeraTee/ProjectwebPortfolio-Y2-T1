            <p>Hi, everyone! Welcome to my blog ! My name is Pattheera Teerarujinont and I am a college student studying at the College of Computing Khon Kaen University.I'm 19 years old. I'm from Thailand. I love samoyed, basketball and listening to music. I got the best education in my college and made many good friends here. Living apart from my parents made me independent and learned to understand the world in my own way. Overall, Life made me grow and leaves a lot of unforgettable memory to me. I am so excited to share with you more of what my blog has to offer! Nice to meet you all.</p>
